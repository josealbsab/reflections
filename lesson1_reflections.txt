How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    helps to focus on specific differences rather than looking at the whole file

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    you can recover parts of your code and/or return to a more stable version of your code

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros: more flexible, empowers the developer
    cons: can be subjective, more prone to judgment errors

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    it depends on the purpose, git might be more suitable for coding

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    inside the repo you call git log, identify the ID of the commits and diff between the commits' IDs you want to compare

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    you can always go back (checkout) to a functional version

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    current dev project
